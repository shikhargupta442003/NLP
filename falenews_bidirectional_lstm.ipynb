[Said Pruitt, \\u201cFAIRtax. org is holding a rally tomorrow and we\\u2019re holding the rally to help remind President Trump of what he promised. Our fear after watching the recent events in Syria, our fear after watching what occurred with Obamacare is that President Trump is going to be urged, he\\u2019s going to get a push from the media, to turn tax reform over to the establishment. \\u201d  \\u201cAnd that\\u2019s exactly what we do not want,\\u201d he continued. \\u201cSo, we felt that at this time it is imperative that all the people who voted for him, who\\u2019s sweat and I believe your previous guest who talked about having blood coming from their feet as they marched for him, we believe that it\\u2019s imperative that we remind President Trump we were there for you. We got you there. When nobody else said you could, we said you can and you will. \\u201d Pruitt also authored a   book titled Planes, Steak  Water: Defending Donald J. Trump in September of 2016. Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern. \",\n          \"Illnois Republican Rep. Peter Roskam told Chicago\\u2019s   that he supported the American Health Care Act crafted by Speaker Paul Ryan ( ) as a necessary fix of the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Obamacare. [\\u201cIt was an improvement as to where we are now,\\u201d he said told the station.  There is a restlessness among the people in his district about Obamacare and what will be done with it, he said. The congressman said during the   battle over the Ryancare bill, he heard from constituents who have been hurt by Obamacare and people helped by Obamacare. In the final bill, Roskam said he received assurances in writing that Illinois would not lose Medicaid protections. He said he was comfortable with concessions given to the House Freedom Caucus, including modifying the Essential Health Benefits  \\u2014   those items required for all policies  \\u2014   so that the EHB\\u2019s were determined the states. \\u201cMy view was that on balance, this bill was a step forward,\\u201d he said. \\u201cFriday was a big disappointment because the bill got pulled, because there was not a lot of support for it so moving forward, there was this notion that this was the healthcare debate,      and I don\\u2019t believe that is true for a second,\\u201d he said. One of the reasons the bill did not pass was that the speaker crafted the bill to meet the requirements of the Senate\\u2019s rules governing budget bills, he said. \\u201cIt is so complicated and so difficult to understand that nobody even hardly understands what you are talking about,\\u201d Roskam said. \\u201cThe better move in the past would have been to pass out of the House \\u2014  even though it\\u2019s not going to move in the Senate \\u2014  the actual proposal \\u2014  what is it you are for? Not with limitations, what are the aspirations?\\u201d Roskam said he is convinced that in the coming weeks, there will be a serious move to reengage the House Republicans about reforming national healthcare policy. \\u201cWe can\\u2019t stay here,\\u201d he said. The next move should be to go back to the two things every American agreed about when President Barack Obama first started the Obamacare debate, he said. First, health care is too expensive and many of the cost drivers are not making us any healthier, he said. Second, it bothered everyone that Americans with   conditions did not have access to insurance coverage. \\u201cIf the Obama administration had focused on those two core things, we would be having a very different conversation about health care today,\\u201d he said.\",\n          \"LOS ANGELES  \\u2014   The entire Hollywood press corps turned up. So did dozens of Chinese executives from the   Dalian Wanda Group, some of whom were introduced as \\u201cspecial dignitaries. \\u201d Studio executives? Check. Leaders from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences? Grinning from the front row. But why were there also four women in gold evening gowns serving as ushers and M. C.\\u2019s? And why was the \\u201cStar Wars\\u201d score used as part of the Monday affair, which was held to promote Wanda\\u2019s $5 billion studio complex in Qingdao as a home away from home for Hollywood? The answer seemed to be: because Wanda wanted it that way. And, at least for eager Hollywood executives hoping to tap into the   Chinese box office, that was answer enough. As the Motion Picture Association of America\\u2019s chief executive, Christopher J. Dodd, said in a video infomercial for the Qingdao complex that played as part of the event, \\u201cAny time an audience grows, everyone benefits. \\u201d The 5 p. m. presentation, held at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, began with remarks by Cheryl Boone Isaacs, president of the academy, an institution dedicated in part to celebrating artistic freedom. \\u201cWe have so much in common,\\u201d Ms. Boone Isaacs said of the Chinese and American film industries. \\u201cArt. Creativity. Conscience. Conviction. Just telling your story. \\u201d Hollywood, of course, has been frustrated that Chinese censors restrict the flow of American films into China only a few dozen foreign films are allowed to be exhibited annually. But Ms. Boone Isaacs kept it gauzy. \\u201cThis art form, like an   carousel, is at its best when it takes us around the world,\\u201d she said of cinema. Next up: Eric Garcetti, the mayor of Los Angeles, who has made bolstering the movie industry a priority of his administration. Specifically, he has criticized the practice of studios moving production to other states and countries to take advantage of tax incentives and rebates. That, of course, is exactly the kind of runaway production funding that Wanda announced at Monday\\u2019s event. Mr. Garcetti tried to have it both ways. After noting that efforts to bring back production have borne fruit, he said, \\u201cWe also are not a place that closes in. \\u201d He added, \\u201cWe will be strong about promoting Los Angeles as a place to film, but we will also be proud to make those international links that are core to our businesses growing. \\u201d With that, Mr. Garcetti introduced Wang Jianlin, Wanda\\u2019s chairman. For his part, Mr. Wang spent most of his speech (delivered in Mandarin, with translation provided to the audience via headphones) highlighting the spectacular growth of the Chinese box office. Within a decade, he noted, China will not only far surpass the United States as a movie marketplace, it will control more than 40 percent of global ticket sales. He got a round of applause when he said that American studios needed to \\u201cimprove the quality\\u201d of their movies. \\u201cIn the recent few years, perhaps because Hollywood movies are trying to minimize their risk, there are less original movies,\\u201d he said. After criticizing Hollywood\\u2019s   on special effects, he added, \\u201cNow that Chinese audiences are smarter, they do not so easily become happy. \\u201d It was almost a wrap. But first came more details about the 40 percent rebate Wanda will offer studios for filming at its    \\u201cmovie metropolis\\u201d in Qingdao. Invited to the stage were executives from studios that had already signed up, including Lionsgate,   Legendary Entertainment, Arclight Films and Kylin Pictures. As one of the women in gold gowns said in closing, \\u201cIt\\u2019s very exciting!\\u201d\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Schrode had joined others from the camp in solidarity as they prayed on the shoreline. \\nA confrontation erupted after law enforcement dismantled a wooden bridge that demonstrators constructed to access the sacred site. \\n\\u201cI was shot in point blank range,\\u201d said Schrode, who says she is shaken but physically will recover. \\u201cAnother water protector was also shot at twice at point blank range, but the rubber bullet hit the water, and not him.\\u201d \\nIn a press release, the Morton County Sheriff\\u2019s Department said it used \\u201cless-than-lethal ammunition to control the situation\\u201d when a man threw bottles at officers on the police line and when another charged the police line. \\u201cOfficers also deployed pepper spray and tear gas to disperse the group of protesters who came across the water and camp at officers,\\u201d the release said. \\nEven as law enforcement warned protesters to leave the area and return to their camp, demonstrators could be heard yelling back at police. \\n\\u201cThere was absolutely no provocation of any kind,\\u201d said film director Josh Fox, who was also on scene. \\u201cThe police pepper sprayed people sitting in the water.\\u201d \\nLaw enforcement vehicles and personnel have been stationed on a hill overlooking the shoreline in question for a number of days, and the hill is recognized as a burial ground and sacred site by the Standing Rock Sioux. \\nOn Monday, people who identified themselves as water protectors waded across the creek to the hill to request that law enforcement move off the sacred area. \\nAccording to the Morton County Sheriff\\u2019s Department public information officer, the police remained there \\u201cto prevent criminal trespass on private property.\\u201d \\nWednesday, the Department said The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers gave Morton County orders to remove a wooden pedestrian bridge that had been constructed across the river and arrest any individuals who cross the river for criminal trespass. \\n\\u201cI was facing the line of officers from across the river and all of a sudden, I felt as if someone swung a mallet with all their might against my lower back.

I think it is a sad thing he was treated so badly. In addition to that, from intelligence, papers are being leaked, things are leaked. It is a criminal action. It\\u2019s a criminal act. It has been going on for a long time, before me. Now, it is really going on. People are trying to cover up for a terrible loss that the Democrats had under Hillary Clinton. I think that it is very, very unfair what happened to General Flynn, the way he was treated and the documents and papers that were illegally, I stress that, illegally leaked. Very very unfair. \\u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN\",\n          \"The election of a president of the United States isn\\u2019t just democracy in circuslike action. It also may be, at its core, the most elaborate and expensive recruitment and hiring process that mankind has ever created. You can think of a presidential election as being like a particularly large company\\u2019s search for a chief executive. In this case, the search costs a couple of billion dollars (the amount that will be expended on campaigns) has a hiring committee of 127 million people (the number of voters last cycle) and is covered at every turn by virtually every media organization on earth. What, then, can the latest evidence about best hiring practices tell us about the election, in which hiring the best employee has particularly high stakes? Good news: The answers might just make you feel a little better about American democracy. In the last several years, there has been a lot of evidence, both from academic work and from companies that approach recruitment analytically, that traditional job interviews aren\\u2019t particularly good tools for identifying the best employees. One conclusion: It\\u2019s a bad idea to hire someone primarily based on a job interview, or on a manager\\u2019s gut instinct. Some people perform better when being interviewed, but that seems to be a   skill. It doesn\\u2019t tell you much about whether a person would be a good software engineer or accountant. \\u201cInterviewers are likely to feel they are getting useful information from unstructured interviews, even when they are useless,\\u201d concluded a 2013 article in the academic journal Judgment and Decision Making. \\u201cOur simple recommendation for those who make screening decisions is not to use them,\\u201d wrote Jason Dana, Robyn Dawes and Nathanial Peterson. Major companies have come to the same conclusion. Google long had a reputation for putting job candidates through multiple interviews and asking potential employees    questions to see how they responded. Not anymore. \\u201cWe looked at tens of thousands of interviews, and everyone who had done the interviews and what they scored the candidate, and how that person ultimately performed in their job,\\u201d Google\\u2019s chief human resources executive, Laszlo Bock, told The New York Times in 2013. \\u201cWe found zero relationship. It\\u2019s a complete random mess. \\u201d Maybe the search committee for the next president  \\u2014   that is, every American voter  \\u2014   shouldn\\u2019t put too much weight on what they see in unstructured press interviews with candidates. I argue that speeches and debate performances fit the same pattern, in that they are performances that don\\u2019t tell you a ton about how a person would perform in the vast portion of the presidency that takes place  . So what does work? Google found that structured interviews, in which applicants are asked uniform, concrete questions, were helpful. And a large body of work suggests that tests and simulations can give particularly useful information about how a person will perform on the job. Economists looked at data from firms employing   workers, in which some managers had the discretion to hire the employees they thought were the best fit, while others relied on a performance test. Those hired with tests alone stayed in the jobs 15 percent longer than those chosen by managers, a sign they were a better match. And in an experiment with British doctors, a daylong series of simulations, such as interaction with an actor playing a sick patient, more accurately predicted their future performance than a   test. Plenty of companies in a wide range of fields have embraced the idea. Consulting firms like McKinsey have long hired bright young M. B. A.s in part by giving them a case study of a business challenge and asking them a series of questions about how they would approach the problem. If tests and simulations are the way to go in picking an employee, what does that mean for picking a president? Perhaps the ideal scenario would be to put Ted Cruz and Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders through a simulation in which they must jump between persuading a member of Congress to vote for a highway bill and conducting an arms control negotiation. That won\\u2019t happen anytime soon. But in a weird way, we might be seeing a version of exactly that simulation. What are the qualities it takes to be a successful president? He or she needs to be good at hiring and trusting the right people making constant big decisions with limited information and often while exhausted setting the right big picture strategy and knowing when to stick with it as circumstances change and when to make tactical adjustments. If you look at it that way, running a presidential campaign starts to look like exactly the kind of simulation of being president that our search committee needs to pick a president! The leading candidates in this campaign come from very different backgrounds: two senators, a former secretary of state and a businessman, which makes it hard to judge them against one another. But right now we\\u2019re seeing an    comparison in how they run a campaign. Is the campaign disciplined and well run, displaying the aforementioned mix of smart   strategy and clever tactical choices? Does the candidate hire skilled employees and put trust in people who are competent? Does the candidate have the kind of stamina to put in the long hours of campaigning, or does that person get tired and say the wrong thing or make bad decisions? It\\u2019s easy to criticize the length of American campaigns, and the complexity of the system by which delegates are selected to choose each party\\u2019s nominee. But in a weird way, the duration and complexity of the task make campaigns an even better hiring test. Just as a daylong simulation was a better way to judge the competence of British doctors than a   test, a long campaign gives more time for a person to flunk the simulation by making bad strategic decisions, listening to bad advice or saying something stupid. In early 2008, a person would have had plenty of reason to be skeptical about whether Barack Obama, who had served in the Senate for about three years and had never run anything larger than his Senate office, had the leadership chops to run the entire federal government. The fact that he ran his primary campaign more effectively than Mrs. Clinton was one piece of evidence that he did. The American campaign system has evolved over the years without any master plan. But whenever you groan about yet another state primary or long debate, look at it this way: If you were on the search committee to hire a C. E. O. you would want the longest, hardest simulation you could get. And in your role on this very large search committee, that\\u2019s exactly what you\\u2019re getting.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Schrode had joined others from the camp in solidarity as they prayed on the shoreline. \\nA confrontation erupted after law enforcement dismantled a wooden bridge that demonstrators constructed to access the sacred site. \\n\\u201cI was shot in point blank range,\\u201d said Schrode, who says she is shaken but physically will recover. \\u201cAnother water protector was also shot at twice at point blank range, but the rubber bullet hit the water, and not him.\\u201d \\nIn a press release, the Morton County Sheriff\\u2019s Department said it used \\u201cless-than-lethal ammunition to control the situation\\u201d when a man threw bottles at officers on the police line and when another charged the police line. \\u201cOfficers also deployed pepper spray and tear gas to disperse the group of protesters who came across the water and camp at officers,\\u201d the release said. \\nEven as law enforcement warned protesters to leave the area and return to their camp, demonstrators could be heard yelling back at police. \\n\\u201cThere was absolutely no provocation of any kind,\\u201d said film director Josh Fox, who was also on scene. \\u201cThe police pepper sprayed people sitting in the water.\\u201d \\nLaw enforcement vehicles and personnel have been stationed on a hill overlooking the shoreline in question for a number of days, and the hill is recognized as a burial ground and sacred site by the Standing Rock Sioux. \\nOn Monday, people who identified themselves as water protectors waded across the creek to the hill to request that law enforcement move off the sacred area. \\nAccording to the Morton County Sheriff\\u2019s Department public information officer, the police remained there \\u201cto prevent criminal trespass on private property.\\u201d \\nWednesday, the Department said The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers gave Morton County orders to remove a wooden pedestrian bridge that had been constructed across the river and arrest any individuals who cross the river for criminal trespass. \\n\\u201cI was facing the line of officers from across the river and all of a sudden, I felt as if someone swung a mallet with all their might against my lower back.

Very very unfair. \\u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN\",\n          \"The election of a president of the United States isn\\u2019t just democracy in circuslike action. It also may be, at its core, the most elaborate and expensive recruitment and hiring process that mankind has ever created. You can think of a presidential election as being like a particularly large company\\u2019s search for a chief executive. In this case, the search costs a couple of billion dollars (the amount that will be expended on campaigns) has a hiring committee of 127 million people (the number of voters last cycle) and is covered at every turn by virtually every media organization on earth. What, then, can the latest evidence about best hiring practices tell us about the election, in which hiring the best employee has particularly high stakes? Good news: The answers might just make you feel a little better about American democracy. In the last several years, there has been a lot of evidence, both from academic work and from companies that approach recruitment analytically, that traditional job interviews aren\\u2019t particularly good tools for identifying the best employees. One conclusion: It\\u2019s a bad idea to hire someone primarily based on a job interview, or on a manager\\u2019s gut instinct. Some people perform better when being interviewed, but that seems to be a   skill. It doesn\\u2019t tell you much about whether a person would be a good software engineer or accountant. \\u201cInterviewers are likely to feel they are getting useful information from unstructured interviews, even when they are useless,\\u201d concluded a 2013 article in the academic journal Judgment and Decision Making. \\u201cOur simple recommendation for those who make screening decisions is not to use them,\\u201d wrote Jason Dana, Robyn Dawes and Nathanial Peterson. Major companies have come to the same conclusion. Google long had a reputation for putting job candidates through multiple interviews and asking potential employees    questions to see how they responded. Not anymore. \\u201cWe looked at tens of thousands of interviews, and everyone who had done the interviews and what they scored the candidate, and how that person ultimately performed in their job,\\u201d Google\\u2019s chief human resources executive, Laszlo Bock, told The New York Times in 2013. \\u201cWe found zero relationship. It\\u2019s a complete random mess. \\u201d Maybe the search committee for the next president  \\u2014   that is, every American voter  \\u2014   shouldn\\u2019t put too much weight on what they see in unstructured press interviews with candidates. I argue that speeches and debate performances fit the same pattern, in that they are performances that don\\u2019t tell you a ton about how a person would perform in the vast portion of the presidency that takes place  . So what does work? Google found that structured interviews, in which applicants are asked uniform, concrete questions, were helpful. And a large body of work suggests that tests and simulations can give particularly useful information about how a person will perform on the job. Economists looked at data from firms employing   workers, in which some managers had the discretion to hire the employees they thought were the best fit, while others relied on a performance test. Those hired with tests alone stayed in the jobs 15 percent longer than those chosen by managers, a sign they were a better match. And in an experiment with British doctors, a daylong series of simulations, such as interaction with an actor playing a sick patient, more accurately predicted their future performance than a   test. Plenty of companies in a wide range of fields have embraced the idea. Consulting firms like McKinsey have long hired bright young M. B. A.s in part by giving them a case study of a business challenge and asking them a series of questions about how they would approach the problem. If tests and simulations are the way to go in picking an employee, what does that mean for picking a president? Perhaps the ideal scenario would be to put Ted Cruz and Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders through a simulation in which they must jump between persuading a member of Congress to vote for a highway bill and conducting an arms control negotiation. That won\\u2019t happen anytime soon. But in a weird way, we might be seeing a version of exactly that simulation. What are the qualities it takes to be a successful president? He or she needs to be good at hiring and trusting the right people making constant big decisions with limited information and often while exhausted setting the right big picture strategy and knowing when to stick with it as circumstances change and when to make tactical adjustments. If you look at it that way, running a presidential campaign starts to look like exactly the kind of simulation of being president that our search committee needs to pick a president! The leading candidates in this campaign come from very different backgrounds: two senators, a former secretary of state and a businessman, which makes it hard to judge them against one another. But right now we\\u2019re seeing an    comparison in how they run a campaign. Is the campaign disciplined and well run, displaying the aforementioned mix of smart   strategy and clever tactical choices? Does the candidate hire skilled employees and put trust in people who are competent? Does the candidate have the kind of stamina to put in the long hours of campaigning, or does that person get tired and say the wrong thing or make bad decisions? It\\u2019s easy to criticize the length of American campaigns, and the complexity of the system by which delegates are selected to choose each party\\u2019s nominee. But in a weird way, the duration and complexity of the task make campaigns an even better hiring test. Just as a daylong simulation was a better way to judge the competence of British doctors than a   test, a long campaign gives more time for a person to flunk the simulation by making bad strategic decisions, listening to bad advice or saying something stupid. In early 2008, a person would have had plenty of reason to be skeptical about whether Barack Obama, who had served in the Senate for about three years and had never run anything larger than his Senate office, had the leadership chops to run the entire federal government. The fact that he ran his primary campaign more effectively than Mrs. Clinton was one piece of evidence that he did. The American campaign system has evolved over the years without any master plan. But whenever you groan about yet another state primary or long debate, look at it this way: If you were on the search committee to hire a C. E. O. you would want the longest, hardest simulation you could get. And in your role on this very large search committee, that\\u2019s exactly what you\\u2019re getting.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Schrode had joined others from the camp in solidarity as they prayed on the shoreline. \\nA confrontation erupted after law enforcement dismantled a wooden bridge that demonstrators constructed to access the sacred site. \\n\\u201cI was shot in point blank range,\\u201d said Schrode, who says she is shaken but physically will recover. \\u201cAnother water protector was also shot at twice at point blank range, but the rubber bullet hit the water, and not him.\\u201d \\nIn a press release, the Morton County Sheriff\\u2019s Department said it used \\u201cless-than-lethal ammunition to control the situation\\u201d when a man threw bottles at officers on the police line and when another charged the police line. \\u201cOfficers also deployed pepper spray and tear gas to disperse the group of protesters who came across the water and camp at officers,\\u201d the release said. \\nEven as law enforcement warned protesters to leave the area and return to their camp, demonstrators could be heard yelling back at police. \\n\\u201cThere was absolutely no provocation of any kind,\\u201d said film director Josh Fox, who was also on scene. \\u201cThe police pepper sprayed people sitting in the water.\\u201d \\nLaw enforcement vehicles and personnel have been stationed on a hill overlooking the shoreline in question for a number of days, and the hill is recognized as a burial ground and sacred site by the Standing Rock Sioux. \\nOn Monday, people who identified themselves as water protectors waded across the creek to the hill to request that law enforcement move off the sacred area. \\nAccording to the Morton County Sheriff\\u2019s Department public information officer, the police remained there \\u201cto prevent criminal trespass on private property.\\u201d \\nWednesday, the Department said The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers gave Morton County orders to remove a wooden pedestrian bridge that had been constructed across the river and arrest any individuals who cross the river for criminal trespass. \\n\\u201cI was facing the line of officers from across the river and all of a sudden, I felt as if someone swung a mallet with all their might against my lower back. It obliterated me,\\u201d said Schrode. \\u201cI turned around and I had no idea what just happened. And there was an officer pointing his gun in my direction from a boat.\\u201d \\nMorton County called the situation a \\u201cstandoff\\u201d and, in a press release, stated that \\u201cprotesters involved in this activity are violating numerous federal and state laws.\\u201d \\nE\\u2019sha Hoferer , who is a member of the Walker River Paiute Tribe and who says he is in Standing Rock to protect the water for his children and grandchildren, told NBC News before Wednesday\\u2019s encounter with law enforcement that the construction of the pipeline is \\u201cdesecrating a lot of sacred sites\\u201d and that \\u201ca lot of the traditional ecological knowledge that we have \\u2013 that Standing Rock has \\u2013 shows that we have ceremonial sites up there, sacred sites, burial sites,\\u201d referring to the hill at the center of the standoff. \\nThe last big clash between police and demonstrators took place on Thursday, October 27, when 141 protesters were arrested .\",\n          \"Wednesday during a joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, President Donald Trump addressed the resignation of Michael Flynn as National Security Adviser.

I think it is a sad thing he was treated so badly. In addition to that, from intelligence, papers are being leaked, things are leaked. It is a criminal action. It\\u2019s a criminal act. It has been going on for a long time, before me. Now, it is really going on. People are trying to cover up for a terrible loss that the Democrats had under Hillary Clinton.

Very very unfair. \\u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN\",\n          \"The election of a president of the United States isn\\u2019t just democracy in circuslike action. It also may be, at its core, the most elaborate and expensive recruitment and hiring process that mankind has ever created. You can think of a presidential election as being like a particularly large company\\u2019s search for a chief executive. In this case, the search costs a couple of billion dollars (the amount that will be expended on campaigns) has a hiring committee of 127 million people (the number of voters last cycle) and is covered at every turn by virtually every media organization on earth. What, then, can the latest evidence about best hiring practices tell us about the election, in which hiring the best employee has particularly high stakes? Good news: The answers might just make you feel a little better about American democracy. In the last several years, there has been a lot of evidence, both from academic work and from companies that approach recruitment analytically, that traditional job interviews aren\\u2019t particularly good tools for identifying the best employees. One conclusion: It\\u2019s a bad idea to hire someone primarily based on a job interview, or on a manager\\u2019s gut instinct. Some people perform better when being interviewed, but that seems to be a   skill. It doesn\\u2019t tell you much about whether a person would be a good software engineer or accountant. \\u201cInterviewers are likely to feel they are getting useful information from unstructured interviews, even when they are useless,\\u201d concluded a 2013 article in the academic journal Judgment and Decision Making. \\u201cOur simple recommendation for those who make screening decisions is not to use them,\\u201d wrote Jason Dana, Robyn Dawes and Nathanial Peterson. Major companies have come to the same conclusion. Google long had a reputation for putting job candidates through multiple interviews and asking potential employees    questions to see how they responded. Not anymore. \\u201cWe looked at tens of thousands of interviews, and everyone who had done the interviews and what they scored the candidate, and how that person ultimately performed in their job,\\u201d Google\\u2019s chief human resources executive, Laszlo Bock, told The New York Times in 2013. \\u201cWe found zero relationship. It\\u2019s a complete random mess. \\u201d Maybe the search committee for the next president  \\u2014   that is, every American voter  \\u2014   shouldn\\u2019t put too much weight on what they see in unstructured press interviews with candidates. I argue that speeches and debate performances fit the same pattern, in that they are performances that don\\u2019t tell you a ton about how a person would perform in the vast portion of the presidency that takes place  . So what does work? Google found that structured interviews, in which applicants are asked uniform, concrete questions, were helpful. And a large body of work suggests that tests and simulations can give particularly useful information about how a person will perform on the job. Economists looked at data from firms employing   workers, in which some managers had the discretion to hire the employees they thought were the best fit, while others relied on a performance test. Those hired with tests alone stayed in the jobs 15 percent longer than those chosen by managers, a sign they were a better match. And in an experiment with British doctors, a daylong series of simulations, such as interaction with an actor playing a sick patient, more accurately predicted their future performance than a   test. Plenty of companies in a wide range of fields have embraced the idea. Consulting firms like McKinsey have long hired bright young M. B. A.s in part by giving them a case study of a business challenge and asking them a series of questions about how they would approach the problem. If tests and simulations are the way to go in picking an employee, what does that mean for picking a president? Perhaps the ideal scenario would be to put Ted Cruz and Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders through a simulation in which they must jump between persuading a member of Congress to vote for a highway bill and conducting an arms control negotiation. That won\\u2019t happen anytime soon. But in a weird way, we might be seeing a version of exactly that simulation. What are the qualities it takes to be a successful president? He or she needs to be good at hiring and trusting the right people making constant big decisions with limited information and often while exhausted setting the right big picture strategy and knowing when to stick with it as circumstances change and when to make tactical adjustments. If you look at it that way, running a presidential campaign starts to look like exactly the kind of simulation of being president that our search committee needs to pick a president! The leading candidates in this campaign come from very different backgrounds: two senators, a former secretary of state and a businessman, which makes it hard to judge them against one another. But right now we\\u2019re seeing an    comparison in how they run a campaign. Is the campaign disciplined and well run, displaying the aforementioned mix of smart   strategy and clever tactical choices? Does the candidate hire skilled employees and put trust in people who are competent? Does the candidate have the kind of stamina to put in the long hours of campaigning, or does that person get tired and say the wrong thing or make bad decisions? It\\u2019s easy to criticize the length of American campaigns, and the complexity of the system by which delegates are selected to choose each party\\u2019s nominee. But in a weird way, the duration and complexity of the task make campaigns an even better hiring test. Just as a daylong simulation was a better way to judge the competence of British doctors than a   test, a long campaign gives more time for a person to flunk the simulation by making bad strategic decisions, listening to bad advice or saying something stupid. In early 2008, a person would have had plenty of reason to be skeptical about whether Barack Obama, who had served in the Senate for about three years and had never run anything larger than his Senate office, had the leadership chops to run the entire federal government. The fact that he ran his primary campaign more effectively than Mrs. Clinton was one piece of evidence that he did. The American campaign system has evolved over the years without any master plan. But whenever you groan about yet another state primary or long debate, look at it this way: If you were on the search committee to hire a C. E. O. you would want the longest, hardest simulation you could get. And in your role on this very large search committee, that\\u2019s exactly what you\\u2019re getting.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
